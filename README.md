How to connect your GitHub account to Watson
You need to create a branch named exactly 'master' in your repo for the Watson notebook to be cloned to the repo or rename 'main' to 'master'. Create the repo and add its address bar to the 'Settings' tab when launching/creating a project in Watson. You do this at the step in which you enter project name and description. Check the 'right-most' tab labelled 'Settings'. Otherwise you get an error.
